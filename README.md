An online tool to compare stages, platforms, camera bounds, and blast zones overlaid on top of each other.

An HDR version of https://tournameta.com/stage-comparison/

Special thanks to [rubendal](https://github.com/rubendal) who provided the tool to dump this stage information, and to [tournameta](https://tournameta.com/) for collaborating with me to provide their version as a base.
